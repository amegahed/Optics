This database is a compilation of optical design files that are used in the application OpticExplorer (www.opticexplorer.com).

## Contents

### Material Maps
These files describe Abbe diagram material maps.  Material maps are used to show where materials occur in a two dimensinal space defined by their refractivity and their dispersion.  These material map files are defined in OpticExplorer's .abbe (yaml) format.

### Materials
These files that describe materials.  These files are in .mtrl format which is a yaml format created by Mikhail Polyanskiy of http://refractiveindex.info .

### Optics
These are optical system description files.  This set of files is broken down into a number of categories ("Astronomy", Photography", "Microscopy", etc.).   These description files are in either Radiant Zemax's .ZMX (text-based) format or in OpticExplorer's .OPTC (yaml) format.

### Spectra
These files describe the spectra of different types of light sources.  These file are in OpticExplorer's .spct (yaml) format.
